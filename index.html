        <p class="lead mb-4">Whenever I am asked to talk about myself, I love to always bring up soccer because it is what shaped me into who I am today. The long hours of kicking a ball instilled a high work ethic and discipline into me. Meeting people from all walks of life through this sport allowed me to become a well-rounded person who is open to try new things. I have become a very social person because of the teamwork that is heavily emphasized in this sport. I never regret things in life, for I believe that some things don't turn out the way that you want it to for a reason; however, one thing that will hold a grudge on me is that I couldn't become a soccer player. This motivates me to work harder so that I don't have to see my future dreams being crushed.
<br><br>

        Dear Soccer… June 21, 2014; I remember this date as well as my birthday. It was a cool Saturday afternoon with a pleasing weather that I hardly experience nowadays on the southern side of scorching California, and yet, I was inside my room utilizing my one hour game time limit by playing Minecraft with my best friend. Not even halfway through the hour mark, the sound waves of the phrase, “I have to go”, hit my eardrums, eventually reaching my brain for it to comprehend the disappointing words, all in a matter of milliseconds. As I heard the tone of an ended call on Google Hangouts,  I felt empty as my heart dropped down to my feet. 
My feet made way towards the stairs, transitioning from the stained carpet of the first floor to the newly floored wooden planks of the second. I saw my father with his attention invested in the World Cup on television. I haven’t been able to experience much father-son time for a while, so I decided to jump onto the couch and observe beside him. I didn’t fancy sports back then, and I was forced to participate in sports by my parents despite my dislike of balls. But that was until this day.
I saw you playing with two groups of friends through the television. I noticed that you were more fond of Lionel Messi out of all your friends, and I was captivated by the fantastic chemistry you had with him. You seemed as if you were such a generous friend for letting him be the hero that day. I had the deep desire to get to know you, but I knew that someone popular like you would never befriend a loser like me. Yet, there you were, calling out to me and asking me to be your friend. I rushed to my mother and asked if I can buy a ball instead of that iPod that she was planning to purchase for me, and my mother replied, “Yes” with a perplexed face. You made me a new person that day.
Before I met you, I was extremely shy and introverted. I never had more than three friends because of my quiet personality; however, ever since my encounter with you, you have been introducing me to countless numbers of people, which caused me to become more sociable. 
Because I was one of your later friends, I knew that you were more intimate with your other friends compared to me. I always wanted to be your best friend, so I capitalized on every opportunity to spend time with you. Whether I was under the blistering sun or having a shower under the clouds, I would hang around with you no matter what the condition was. I always managed to fit in time with you despite my busy schedule. I saw myself drastically becoming closer to you the more I spent time with you. Whenever I was having a bad day, you would relieve my stress and sadness. You always brought a smile to my face. 
But, there were many instances when you hurt me. Although I invested a large majority of my life on you, you would help others succeed. You wouldn’t make me shine in front of the coaches. You wouldn’t make choose me as the hero of many games. You allowed me to suffer physically from the agonizing cramps mid-game to crevices on my ankle bone. Your friends would verbally abuse me from mockings to racial slurs, but you didn’t stop them. Their parents would look down on me, yet you didn’t stand up for me.
However, I know that you did everything for the benefit of me. Without you, my soul would still be present in my old self. Without you, I wouldn’t be able to connect with others well. Without you, I wouldn’t have been able to know the value of work ethic. Because of you, I know how to persevere. Because of you, I know how to deal with failure. Because of you, my mind and body are stronger. Thanks to you, I am now able to withstand the reality of this world.

        Tick, tock. I feel an unusual sensation in my stomach, not from Mom’s scrumptious pasta noodles that I’ve slurped for lunch, but from the butterflies that flutter within. Tick, tock. There is less than a minute left, and I haven’t spoken a word throughout the Socratic Seminar. Tick, tock. I violently flip through the cream-colored pages of Lord of the Flies. Tick, tock. I attempt to raise my hand. Tick, tock. But I can’t. Ding, dong.
The school bell sounds, followed by the sounds of wrinkling papers and rising zippers. I’m unable to look up, for I can sense the presence of my judgemental peers’ pupils locking onto me along with a squint from the teacher’s eyes. Embarrassed and frustrated are the two words echoing within my brain; embarrassed from not contributing to the discussion; frustrated from my inability to express my ideas despite my desire to. I’m a caterpillar among a classroom full of butterflies. I feel as if I don’t belong here.
Transitioning into high school was difficult because of the foreign land I encountered. After being stuck with the same thirty caterpillars in a secluded private school for my whole life, seeing vibrant explosions of colorful butterflies startled me. Struggling to conform with the glowing personalities of the butterflies due to my gloomy valley of self-esteem, it’s clear that my introverted personality prevents me from transforming into the butterfly that I can become.
It’s the first day of soccer practice. I walk to the soccer field with a slight smile on my face, hoping to finally bond with someone. However, as I arrive, despair fills me as I see players already giggling together as they wear their cleats… except for one, sitting at the top of the bleachers.
Inhale. Exhale. I approach him. My heart beats quickly as if it’s dancing to “Flight of the Bumblebee.” Every step I take creates a growing sense of distress. My mind and body are begging me to escape this uncomfortable feeling, but I’ve already committed.
“Hi, I’m Royce.”
“Royce?”
“Yeah, like Rolls-Royce, the car, vroom vroom!” We both burst into laughter and begin to converse. My caterpillar skin begins to shed.
As time passes, I visit uncharted territories from asking challenging questions to taking initiative in group projects. Every time I intentionally expose myself to discomfort, the exoskeleton that once covered me starts to slip off, leaving behind the old me.
Tick, tock. My right-hand rises and words come out of my mouth. Tick, tock. My wings penetrate, and my cocoon cracks. I’m a butterfly, and I do belong here. Speaking my first words in a Socratic Seminar is merely a warm-up for my newborn wings.
No longer am I phased by opposing opinions of others, for I won’t let my uniquely colored wings fall into the norm of society. No longer is my voice stuck inside of me, for I’m not afraid to flutter my wings to make myself known.
My empathy motivates me to inspire young caterpillars to shed their skin. I listen to the uncertainties of these lost caterpillars, struggling to leave their old self. With my encouragement accelerating the process of improving their self-esteem, the caterpillars are willing to seek discomfort in order to transform and sprout their wings. By standing beside them during their odyssey, they can soar over trees instead of staying on the same leaf. Not only do I help the caterpillars undergo metamorphosis, but I also encourage the butterflies, who stopped flapping their wings, to fly. I have no fear of standing against predators mocking insecure butterflies. By setting an example, the unconfident butterflies are inclined to make use of their beautiful wings.
The butterfly effect is the idea where a small change results in a huge transformation. When I go to college, I won’t ever stop fluttering my wings in hopes that my small flaps will cause the campus to fly.
